# Xbox-360-3rd-Party-USB-C-Mod

A mod to convert the non-detachable cable on **3rd-party** (Rock Candy and Afterglow) wired Xbox 360 controllers to a USB-C port.

https://github.com/HDR/Xbox-360-USB-C-Mod This repository only applies for official wired 360 controllers, not those produced by other manufacturers. (The assembly steps are essentially the same.)
